            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 16, 2025</p>

            <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>By downloading, installing, or using the app provided by Sreeni Paloliyil (Sole Proprietorship) (referred to as the “App”), you agree to these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>

            <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
            <p>The App helps users track USCIS immigration case statuses by allowing users to enter receipt numbers and view status updates retrieved from the official USCIS API. The App is an independent tool and is not affiliated with USCIS.</p>

            <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
            <p>The App is intended for users of all ages. If you are under 13, you must have parental consent. By using the App, you represent that you are legally permitted to use it.</p>

            <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
            <ul style="line-height:1.8; margin-left:20px;">
                <li>Provide accurate case details and keep your device secure.</li>
                <li>Do not share your receipt numbers with unauthorized persons.</li>
                <li>Do not attempt to reverse-engineer or misuse the App.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Accounts and Data</h2>
            <p>The App does not require an account for basic use. Any case data you save is stored locally on your device. If you use optional features that require an email or social login, those data practices are described in the Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h2>6. In-App Purchases</h2>
            <p>If the App offers any in-app purchases, the price and features will be listed in the app store. All purchases are subject to the store's terms and the app's refund policy, if any.</p>

            <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>All content, design, and code in the App are owned by the developer. You may not copy, distribute, or create derivative works without permission.</p>

            <h2>8. Prohibited Activities</h2>
            <p>You agree not to use the App for illegal activities, to interfere with its operation, or to attempt unauthorized access to any related systems.</p>

            <h2>9. Accuracy of Information</h2>
            <p>We strive for accuracy but cannot guarantee the correctness or timeliness of USCIS data displayed. Always verify important case information directly with USCIS.</p>

            <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the developer will not be liable for any damages arising from the use of the app. If you do not agree with this limitation, do not use the app.</p>

            <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>
            <p>You agree to indemnify and hold the developer harmless from claims arising from your use of the App or your violation of these Terms.</p>

            <h2>12. Termination</h2>
            <p>We may suspend or terminate access to the App at any time for violations of these Terms or for business reasons. You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it and deleting local data.</p>

            <h2>13. Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>We may update these Terms. We will post the updated Terms in the app and on our website. If we make material changes that affect your rights or how we use personal data, we will notify you and obtain active consent where required.</p>

            <h2>14. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the state where the developer operates, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>

            <h2>15. Contact Information</h2>
