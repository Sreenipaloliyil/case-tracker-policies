            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

            <h3>1. Is this app affiliated with USCIS?</h3>
            <p>No. This app is an independent tool and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) or any government agency. All status data is sourced from the publicly available USCIS website.</p>

            <h3>2. Where is my case number stored?</h3>
            <p>For your security, your USCIS receipt numbers are stored only on your device and are never transmitted to our servers or shared with any third parties.</p>

            <h3>3. How often does the case status refresh?</h3>
            <p>The app checks your case status every time you open the app or manually refresh the status screen.</p>

            <h3>4. Why is my status not updating?</h3>
            <p>Case status updates depend on the official USCIS system. If the official USCIS website is down or experiencing delays, the app may not be able to retrieve the latest status. Please try again later or check the official USCIS website directly.</p>
