            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 19, 2025</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how Case Tracker collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our app.</p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect only the information you provide directly to the app, such as USCIS receipt numbers and optional case names. No personally identifiable information (PII) like your name, address, or Social Security Number is collected or stored.</p>

            <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>Your information is used solely to retrieve your case status from the official USCIS system and display it within the app. We do not transmit or store this data externally.</p>

            <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
            <p>Case Tracker stores your case information (receipt number, case status, and name) securely on your device using Apple's UserDefaults system. This data never leaves your device unless you share it yourself.</p>

            <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your information with any third parties. Your case data is used only to communicate with the official USCIS API.</p>

            <h2>Data Retention</h2>
            <p>Your saved case data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the app. You can remove individual cases at any time within the app.</p>

            <h2>Security Measures</h2>
            <p>We use Appleâ€™s secure local storage mechanisms and follow best practices to protect your case information from unauthorized access or loss.</p>

            <h2>User Rights</h2>
            <p>You are in full control of your data. You may update or delete your saved cases at any time within the app. We do not maintain any server-side or cloud records of your data.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>The app connects directly to the official USCIS website to fetch case status updates. We do not use any analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. All updates will be posted in the app and include the updated effective date.</p>

            <h2>Contact Us</h2>
