            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Your privacy matters to us. This Privacy Policy explains how Sreeni Paloliyil (Sole Proprietorship) ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, stores, and protects your information when you use our applications and related services (the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to the practices described in this policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the Service.</p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We minimize data collection. The types of data we collect are:</p>
            <ul style="line-height:1.8; margin-left:20px;">
                <li><strong>Receipt Numbers:</strong> Our Service collects USCIS receipt numbers that you enter in order to use the USCIS API and track your case status updates. Because these numbers are unique to your case, they are treated as Personally Identifiable Information (PII).</li>
                <li><strong>Optional Case Names:</strong> You may assign custom names or labels to your cases to help you organize them on your device.</li>
                <li><strong>Device storage metadata:</strong> local storage information needed to save cases on your device (no server-side logs).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>We do not collect:</strong> names, addresses, Social Security Numbers, geolocation, financial information, health/medical data, or your contacts.</p>

            <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <ul style="line-height:1.8; margin-left:20px;">
                <li>To fetch and display USCIS case status updates using the receipt numbers you provide.</li>
                <li>Receipt numbers are only used to make requests to the official USCIS case status service and are not shared with third parties.</li>
                <li>To allow you to save, view, and manage the cases you enter on your device.</li>
                <li>To respond to your support or privacy requests when you contact us.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
            <p>All case information you enter is stored locally on your device using Apple’s standard local storage mechanisms (e.g., UserDefaults). We do not maintain any server-side or cloud copies of your saved case data unless you explicitly export or share it yourself.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>Our Service fetches case status updates directly from USCIS. We do not include analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs in the current release. If this changes, we will disclose the services and obtain any required consents.</p>

            <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade personal data for profit or other monetary consideration. We will only share data when required by law or with your explicit consent.</p>
            
            <h2>User Rights and Choices</h2>
                <ul style="line-height:1.8; margin-left:20px;">
                    <li><strong>Access and Review:</strong> You can view the USCIS receipt numbers and case names you have entered at any time within the app.</li>
                    <li><strong>Correction:</strong> If you enter a receipt number incorrectly, you can edit or update it directly in the app.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete any or all receipt numbers and case names you have stored in the app at any time. Once deleted, they are permanently removed from your device and are not recoverable by us.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consent Withdrawal:</strong> If you no longer wish to use the app to fetch USCIS case status updates, you may stop using the app and delete any stored receipt numbers.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Data Retention</h2>
            <p>Your case data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the app. If you ask us to delete any data we hold (for example, support attachments or logs you explicitly sent to us), we will remove it as described in the <strong>Data Deletion</strong> section below.</p>

            <h2>Data Deletion (How to Request)</h2>
            <p>You can permanently delete your app data in two ways:</p>
            <ul style="line-height:1.8; margin-left:20px;">
                <li>From the app: Open the app and remove individual case entries or clear all saved cases.</li>
                <li>By request: Email <a href="mailto:contact.casetracker@gmail.com">contact.casetracker@gmail.com</a> to request deletion of any data we may have received from you. We will confirm receipt of your request and act on it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Deletion timeline:</strong> We will complete data deletion within <strong>30 days</strong> of receiving a valid deletion request, unless a longer period is required by law. We will confirm when deletion is complete.</p>

            <h2>Account Closure</h2>
            <p>Our Service does not require an account for normal use. If you created an account through social login or provided an email for support, contact us at <a href="mailto:contact.casetracker@gmail.com">contact.casetracker@gmail.com</a> to close the account and request data removal. Account closure and associated deletions will be completed within 30 days of verification.</p>

            <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
            <p>Our app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has shared personal information through the app, contact us at <a href="mailto:contact.casetracker@gmail.com">contact.casetracker@gmail.com</a> and we will remove the information.</p>

            <h2>Security Measures</h2>
            <p>We use industry standard practices to protect local data on the device and follow Apple platform security recommendations. However, no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure. If you need extra protection, avoid storing sensitive PII in the app.</p>

            <h2>Data Breach Notification</h2>
            <p>If we become aware of a security breach that affects your personal information, we will notify you as soon as reasonably possible in accordance with applicable law. Notifications will include information about the breach and recommended next steps.</p>

            <h2>Changes in Ownership</h2>
            <p>If our business is sold, merged, or transferred, your data may be transferred to the new owner. We will notify you of any such transfer and provide options to export or delete your data before the transfer is completed.</p>

            <h2>California Privacy Rights (CCPA)</h2>
            <p>If you are a California resident, you have the following rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):</p>
            <ul style="line-height:1.8; margin-left:20px;">

                <li><strong>Right to delete:</strong> request deletion of personal data we hold about you.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to opt-out:</strong> opt out of the sale of your personal data. (Note: We do not sell personal data.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:contact.casetracker@gmail.com">contact.casetracker@gmail.com</a>. We will verify and respond to CCPA requests within the timelines required by law (typically within 45 days; we may extend once by 45 days if needed and will notify you).</p>

            <h2>International Transfers</h2>
            <p>Data stored locally on your device stays on your device. If you provide data that is transferred to the United States or other countries for support or troubleshooting, you consent to that transfer.</p>

            <h2>Active Consent for Policy Changes</h2>
            <p>If we make material changes to how we collect or use personal data, we will notify you in the app and, if required by law, obtain your active consent before applying those changes to previously collected data.</p>
